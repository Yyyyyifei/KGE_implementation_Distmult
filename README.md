# Distmult model implementation for 

This project is a Distmult model implementation for Knowledge graph completion

## Details of implementation
Sample corruption: Random replacement of head/tail
Dataset choice: FB15K-237
Loss function: Multiclass Negative Log-likelihood
Tie-breaking Policy: random

## [TODO: ]Extension
Sample corruption: Bernouli distribution, Self-adversarial
Tie-breaking Policy: min/max
Loss function: Pairwise Ranking
